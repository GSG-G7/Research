# Express Middlewares
* What are express Middlewares?
<br>
It is an easy way to specify the things should happen between requests and responses.
<br>
It processes http requests and give an appropriate response.
 
* What exactly is a middleware?
<br>
It is a code that sits/lies between two layers (in express it lies between the request and response).
<br>
It handles certain requests and provides certain responses automatically.
<br><br>

# Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

* Execute any code.
* Make changes to the request and the response objects.
* End the request-response cycle.
* Call the next middleware function in the stack.

# Middleware Types:

## Built-in middleware

We use the following built-In middleware to serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files.
<br>
The most common example of Built-In express middleware is:
```
app.use(express.static(root))
```
<br>

## Application-level middleware
Bind application-level middleware to an instance of the app object by using the  ```app.use()``` and ```app.METHOD()``` functions, where METHOD is the HTTP method of the request that the middleware function handles (such as GET, PUT, or POST) in lowercase.
```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const myLogger = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now());
  next();
};

app.use(myLogger);

app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.get('/city', function(req, res) {
  res.send('Hello City!');
});

app.listen(3000);
```
<br>

### Router-level middleware
Router-level middleware works in the same way as application-level middleware, except it is bound to an instance of ```express.Router()```

```
const router = express.Router();

router.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Time:', Date.now());
    next();
});

router.use('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl);
    next();
}, (req, res, next) => {
    next();
});

router.get('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {
    if (req.params.id === '0') next('route');
    else next();
}, (req, res, next) => {
    res.send('regular');
});

router.get('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {
    res.send('special')
});

// mount the router on the app
app.use('/', router);
  ```
  <br>

### Error-handling middleware
Error-handling middleware always takes four arguments. You must provide four arguments to identify it as an error-handling middleware function. Even if you donâ€™t need to use the next object, you must specify it to maintain the signature. Otherwise, the next object will be interpreted as regular middleware and will fail to handle errors.
```
app.use( (err, req, res, next) => {
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!')
});
```
