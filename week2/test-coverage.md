# Test Coverage
# **What is Test Coverage?** :point_down:
It is a technique to ensure that your tests are testing your code or how much of your code you exercised by running the test.


# **Benefits of Test Coverage**
- It can assure the quality of the test and defect prevention at early stages of project life cycle.
- It can help identify what portions of the code were actually touched for the release or fix.
- Determine the paths in your application that were not tested.
- Time, scope and cost can be kept under control.
- Gaps in requirements, test cases and defects at the unit level and code level can be found in an easy way.
